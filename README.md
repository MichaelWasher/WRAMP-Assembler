# WRAMP-Assembler
A Waikato RISC Architecture Micro Processor (WRAMP) Encoder for WRAMP Assembly Language.

This is a small Assembler tool that can be used for encoding WRAMP-RISC assembly language into a usable binary package for use with the WRAMP boards and emulator designed The University of Waikto (UoW). These boards are used in their 200 and 300 level courses (specifically COMP200 and COMP311) to introduce computer architecture and high-level language design.

The Assembler was started as a small project whilst studying at UoW and is available under the MIT license.
